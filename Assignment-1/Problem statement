#Problem statement....

Implement the class Complex with data members for real and imaginary parts of complex number.
Add default constructor, parameterized constructor, accept and display functions inside the class 
Complex.
Default Constructor – Will initialize real and img to values 0
Parameterized Constructor – Will initialize real and img to values passed inside constructor
Accept function – Will accept the Complex number from user
Display function – Will display the Complex number into “a+bi” format
Overload operators +, - , ++ (pre and post increment), == in the above class Complex.
Operator+ will perform addition of two Complex objects.
Addition of two complex objects is nothing but addition of their corresponding real 
and imaginary parts.
Operator- will perform subtraction of two Complex objects.
Subtraction of two complex objects is nothing but subtraction of their
corresponding real and imaginary parts.
++(pre and post) – will add 1 to the real and img parts of Complex number
== operator will compare two complex objects are same. i.e. their corresponding real and 
imaginary parts are same.
Declaration of class Complex is given below for your reference. You need to complete its definition.
class Complex
{
int real;
int img;
Public:
Complex();
Complex(int, int);
void Accept();
void Display();
Complex operator+(Complex &);
Complex operator-(Complex &);
Complex operator++();
Complex operator++(int);
bool operator==(Complex&);
};
